SCAPI - The Secure Computation API
==================================

What is SCAPI?
--------------

SCAPI is an open-source Java library for implementing secure two-party and multiparty computation protocols (SCAPI stands for the "Secure Computation API"). It provides a reliable, efficient, and highly flexible cryptographic infrastructure. 

Where are the docs?
-------------------

Go to [http://scapi.readthedocs.org/](http://scapi.readthedocs.org/) 
for a prebuilt version of the current documentation. 
Otherwise build them yourself from the sphinx sources in the docs folder.

More information about SCAPI and the motivation behind it appears in this [paper](http://crypto.biu.ac.il/scapi/scapi.pdf).

What if I need help?
--------------------

The docs are great, and you can always email us at [scapi@biu.ac.il](mailto:scapi@biu.ac.il).

Contributing to SCAPI
---------------------

We will be very happy to receive contributions of new code that extends SCAPI (under the condition that it is cleanly written, well documented, and fits into the SCAPI design paradigm). We do love to see fresh [pull-requests](https://github.com/cryptobiu/scapi/pulls) 
in the morning! :)

We also encourage you to open new [issues](https://github.com/cryptobiu/scapi/issues), but only if you really mean it!
